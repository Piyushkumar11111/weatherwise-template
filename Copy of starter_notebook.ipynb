🧰 Setup and Imports

This section imports commonly used packages and installs any additional tools used in the project.

You may not need all of these unless you're using specific features (e.g. visualisations, advanced prompting).
The notebook assumes the following packages are pre-installed in the provided environment or installable via pip:
requests, matplotlib, pyinputplus
fetch-my-weather (for accessing weather data easily)
hands-on-ai (for AI logging, comparisons, or prompting tools)
If you're running this notebook in Google Colab, uncomment the following lines to install the required packages.

🌦️ WeatherWise – Starter Notebook

Welcome to your WeatherWise project notebook! This scaffold is designed to help you build your weather advisor app using Python, visualisations, and AI-enhanced development.

📄 Full Assignment Specification
See ASSIGNMENT.md or check the LMS for full details.

📝 Quick Refresher
A one-page summary is available in resources/assignment-summary.md.

🧠 This Notebook Structure is Optional
You’re encouraged to reorganise, rename sections, or remove scaffold cells if you prefer — as long as your final version meets the requirements.

✅ You may delete this note before submission.
