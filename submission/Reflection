 Project Reflection

AI Tools Used
For my project, I used a smart helper called ChatGPT. 
It is like a robot that talks and helps you write code and understand hard things. 
I also used something called GitHub Copilot, which helps you finish your code like magic.
These tools helped me a lot when I was stuck or didn’t know how to write something.
For example, I wanted to make a weather app that shows temperature, rain, wind, and clouds. 
ChatGPT helped me write the Python code and explain what each line does. Copilot helped me finish some lines faster.
Using AI tools made my work easier and faster. It felt like having a smart friend who is always there to help.

Prompting Techniques
When I talked to ChatGPT, I tried to be very clear.
I used simple questions like, “How do I get rain data from this?” or “Can you help me show clouds in my app?” 
I learned that asking clear and small questions gives better answers.
I also used examples when I asked, like “I want it to look like this: 40% rain.” That helped the AI understand me better.
I also said what I wanted in each step. Like, “First show the temperature, then the rain,” and that worked well. So now I know that step-by-step questions are very useful!

What Worked Well?
One thing I am really proud of is my weather project!
I made a program where you can type a city and it tells you the weather like temperature, rain chance, and even a weather description like “partly cloudy.” 
I used real weather data from the internet using something called wttr.in. It felt very cool to see real weather from places like Perth, London, or Tokyo in my app.
I also made the program look nice by adding emojis. That made it fun and easy to read.

 What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would make a real app with buttons instead of typing.
Right now, the program runs in code, and you have to type the day and the weather type. 
If I knew how to build websites or phone apps, I would make it like a game where you click to see the weather. 
I also want to learn how to make it talk, like “Today it will rain!” That would be fun.

 Final Thoughts
I had a lot of fun doing this project. I learned how to use AI helpers and how to read data from the internet.
Before this, I didn’t know how weather websites worked. Now I do! I also feel happy that I made something by myself, with a little help from AI.
Using tools like ChatGPT and Copilot made me feel smarter and more confident. I want to do more projects like this in the future!
